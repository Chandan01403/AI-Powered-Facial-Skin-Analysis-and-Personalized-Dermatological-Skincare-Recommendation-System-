# ✨ AI-Based Facial Skin Analysis and Personalized Skincare Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an intelligent skincare assistant that analyzes facial images and provides personalized skincare recommendations based on detected skin conditions. Using computer vision and deep learning, the system can identify issues such as acne, pigmentation, dark spots, wrinkles, and dryness, and then suggest skincare routines or products tailored to the user’s skin type and concerns.

The purpose of this system is to support dermatology-inspired guidance and help users make smarter skincare decisions.
